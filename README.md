# NLP Project - Song Analysis


## Coding environment details:
Coding was performed on Jupyter Notebook (localhost). However, it should work on any form of Jupyter.

## Libraries:
Necessary libraries are imported in the code.
Unless otherwise noted, library versions are the most recent versions. Any new libraries not yet used in the class were installed via pip and the latest version.

## Contributions:
Theo: Worked on the song lyric commercial performance task as shown in the file `Song Lyrics and Commercial Performance Task - Primary Code.ipynb`. Engineered features based on the lyrics data and developed a model to predict the popularity. For this task, the input is a set of lyrics and the output is the popularity. 

Sriyans: Worked primarily on the initial data analysis phase for the commercial performance task. This included generating metrics and plots. For this portion, the code is in the `Song Lyrics and Commercial Performance Task - Supplementary Code.ipynb` file. NOTE: this is a large file, so it may not render on GitHub. Please download it to see it.

## Final results:
For the song lyric commercial performance task we achieved a RMSE of about 23.54 (the scale of predictions is 0-100).



## Datasets
For the commercial performance task (primary code), the following dataset was used:  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imuhammad/audio-features-and-lyrics-of-spotify-songs  
Make sure to rename it to `data.csv`.
This notebook also uses the file `explicit_words.txt` to check for explicit words. It is available at the Drive link here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zs_IN5WHrJ-WsPj3IMOxn871Bt6eZ6Ia?usp=sharing


For the commercial performance task (supplementary code), we have uploaded the datasets used to the following Drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zs_IN5WHrJ-WsPj3IMOxn871Bt6eZ6Ia?usp=sharing. Note that some of the data used in the notebook is scraped in the notebook code.
